Preliminary Installation Instructions

(See also: http://common-lisp.net/project/closure/quickstart.html)


Provide yourself with:

 1. CMUCL, SBCL, or another supported implementation

    [For what it is worth, I use 18d-pre]

 2. djpeg

    [Debian package libjpeg-progs]

 3. gif2png

    [Debian package gif2png]

 4. McCLIM, Closure XML, and their dependencies

      http://common-lisp.net/project/cxml/ ]


Compile closure using ASDF: Register closure.asd in your central
registry and run:

Then start Closure:

* (closure:start)
