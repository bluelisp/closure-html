Preliminary Installation Instructions

Provide yourself with:

 1. CMUCL

    [For what it is worth, I use 18d-pre]

 2. djpeg

    [Debian package libjpeg-progs]

 3. gif2png

    [Debian package gif2png]


There is a script named BUILD. After executing it, if you are lucky
this will leave you with a lisp.core which contains closure.

Fire up the the newly build core:

$ lisp -core lisp.core

Then start Closure:

* (closure:start)
