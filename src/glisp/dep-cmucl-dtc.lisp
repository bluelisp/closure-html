RUN-PROGRAM is an external symbol in the EXTENSIONS package.
Function: #<Function RUN-PROGRAM {12E7B79}>
Function arguments:
  (program args &key (env *environment-list*) (wait t) pty input
   if-input-does-not-exist output (if-output-exists :error) (error :output)
   (if-error-exists :error) status-hook)
Function documentation:
  Run-program creates a new process and runs the unix progam in the
   file specified by the simple-string program.  Args are the standard
   arguments that can be passed to a Unix program, for no arguments
   use NIL (which means just the name of the program is passed as arg 0).

   Run program will either return NIL or a PROCESS structure.  See the CMU
   Common Lisp Users Manual for details about the PROCESS structure.

   The keyword arguments have the following meanings:
     :env -
        An A-LIST mapping keyword environment variables to simple-string
        values.
     :wait -
        If non-NIL (default), wait until the created process finishes.  If
        NIL, continue running Lisp until the program finishes.
     :pty -
        Either T, NIL, or a stream.  Unless NIL, the subprocess is established
        under a PTY.  If :pty is a stream, all output to this pty is sent to
        this stream, otherwise the PROCESS-PTY slot is filled in with a stream
        connected to pty that can read output and write input.
     :input -
        Either T, NIL, a pathname, a stream, or :STREAM.  If T, the standard
        input for the current process is inherited.  If NIL, /dev/null
        is used.  If a pathname, the file so specified is used.  If a stream,
        all the input is read from that stream and send to the subprocess.  If
        :STREAM, the PROCESS-INPUT slot is filled in with a stream that sends 
        its output to the process. Defaults to NIL.
     :if-input-does-not-exist (when :input is the name of a file) -
        can be one of:
           :error - generate an error.
           :create - create an empty file.
           nil (default) - return nil from run-program.
     :output -
        Either T, NIL, a pathname, a stream, or :STREAM.  If T, the standard
        output for the current process is inherited.  If NIL, /dev/null
        is used.  If a pathname, the file so specified is used.  If a stream,
        all the output from the process is written to this stream. If
        :STREAM, the PROCESS-OUTPUT slot is filled in with a stream that can
        be read to get the output. Defaults to NIL.
     :if-output-exists (when :input is the name of a file) -
        can be one of:
           :error (default) - generates an error if the file already exists.
           :supersede - output from the program supersedes the file.
           :append - output from the program is appended to the file.
           nil - run-program returns nil without doing anything.
     :error and :if-error-exists - 
        Same as :output and :if-output-exists, except that :error can also be
        specified as :output in which case all error output is routed to the
        same place as normal output.
     :status-hook -
        This is a function the system calls whenever the status of the
        process changes.  The function takes the process as an argument.
Its defined argument types are:
  (T T &KEY (:ENV T) (:WAIT T) (:PTY T) (:INPUT T) (:IF-INPUT-DOES-NOT-EXIST T)
   (:OUTPUT T) (:IF-OUTPUT-EXISTS T) (:ERROR T) (:IF-ERROR-EXISTS T)
   (:STATUS-HOOK T))
Its result type is:
  (OR EXTENSIONS::PROCESS NULL)
